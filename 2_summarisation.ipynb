      "underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record \n",
      "by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the \n",
      "record date is prior to the date of issuance of the Shares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such \n",

      "which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \n",
      "amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the \n",
      "percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total \n",

      "one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \n",
      "Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-\n",
      "Related Items. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to \n",
      "the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares \n",
      "with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or \n",
      "assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights \n",
      "with respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n",
      "8. Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this \n",
      "Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to \n",
      "the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of \n",

       "'EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n\\nInnovexa\\u202fHoldings concluded Fiscal\\u202fYear\\u202f2024 in a solid strategic and financial position, despite the overhang of inflationary pressure, supply‑chain dislocation, and uneven enterprise‑IT sentiment. Full‑year revenue climbed to 1\\u202fbillion\\u202f260\\u202fmillion US\\u202fdollars, an increase of roughly twelve percent compared with the prior year, while net profit improved to 147\\u202fmillion dollars. Operating cash flow reached 184\\u202fmillion dollars, supporting a free‑cash‑flow margin above thirteen percent. Management attributes the advance to a disciplined shift toward higher‑margin recurring subscriptions, a moderation in component costs during the second half, and early benefits from the Horizon\\u202f2030 transformation program.\\nThe company has three reportable segments. Core\\u202fSolutions, which delivers application‑modernisation and hybrid‑cloud migration services, produced 43\\u202fpercent of revenue and grew seventeen percent year over year. Cloud\\u202fIntegration, focused on API orchestration and data‑fabric design, represented 34\\u202fpercent of revenue and expanded eleven percent. The Legacy\\u202fLicensing segment contracted three percent, now representing twenty‑three percent of the top line, as on‑premises perpetual sales continue to decline in line with management expectations.\\nGlobal macro headwinds were most visible during the first quarter, when a pause in procurement cycles reduced order intake by nine percent versus the comparable 2023 period. Orders steadily recovered through the remainder of the year, finishing four percent above prior year in the fourth quarter. Pipeline velocity is tracking twenty‑two percent ahead of the prior‑year‐to‑date pace as of March\\u202f2025, reflecting renewed demand for mid‑market digitisation projects in North\\u202fAmerica and Europe.\\n\\nMARKET OVERVIEW\\n\\nIndustry analysts continue to forecast high‑single‑digit compound annual growth for cloud‑native middleware and digital‑transformation consulting through 2028. The total addressable market for Innovexa’s portfolio is estimated at sixty‑seven\\u202fbillion dollars. North\\u202fAmerica and the EMEA region together generated seventy‑four percent of company revenue during 2024. Asia‑Pacific contributed eighteen percent, powered by strong demand in Australia, India, and Japan, while Latin\\u202fAmerica accounted for the remaining eight percent.\\nCompetition intensified as tier‑one global system integrators pressed further into the mid‑market; nevertheless, Innovexa maintained a mid‑teens market share thanks to deep domain expertise in regulated verticals such as financial services and life sciences. Gartner’s latest Magic\\u202fQuadrant placed the firm in the Leaders section for Hybrid‑Cloud Orchestration, citing its robust reference architecture, a service‑level track record above 99.98\\u202fpercent uptime, and its consultative account‑management model.\\n\\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\\n\\nRevenue rose from 1\\u202fbillion\\u202f127\\u202fmillion dollars to 1\\u202fbillion\\u202f259\\u202fmillion dollars. Gross margin expanded by 130\\u202fbasis points to 42.5\\u202fpercent, reflecting a richer software mix and incremental services automation. Operating expenses were held to growth of eight percent. Research‑and‑development investment remained at six‑and‑a‑half percent of revenue, supporting the release of the CX‑Fusion\\u202f5.0 platform, while selling, general, and administrative expenses were flat as a percentage of sales. Diluted earnings per share increased to 1\\u202fdollar\\u202f57\\u202fcents, compared with 1\\u202fdollar\\u202f45\\u202fcents in fiscal\\u202f2023.\\nStrong cash generation permitted 48\\u202fmillion dollars of share repurchases, 31\\u202fmillion dollars in bolt‑on acquisitions, and the retirement of the remaining 25\\u202fmillion dollars on the 2025 convertible‑note tranche without jeopardising liquidity. The year‑end net‑cash position was 96\\u202fmillion dollars. Innovexa maintains an undrawn revolving credit facility of 300\\u202fmillion dollars.\\n\\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\\n\\n–\\u202fThe company completed 128 enterprise go‑lives of CX‑Fusion\\u202f5.0, reducing average client onboarding time by twenty‑seven days and saving an estimated five million dollars in cumulative professional‑services labour.\\n\\n–\\u202fThree tuck‑in acquisitions—NovaSec\\u202fAI, DataMesh\\u202fLabs, and Blue\\u202fKite\\u202fSolutions—added two hundred twenty specialised engineers and accelerated the rollout of AI‑powered quality‑assurance tooling.\\n\\n–\\u202fA robotics‑enabled warehouse redesign reduced fulfilment expense by four‑point‑seven million dollars annually. Hardware lead times declined from forty‑one to twenty‑nine days.\\n\\n–\\u202fSystem uptime across all SaaS instances reached 99.982\\u202fpercent, surpassing the 99.95‑percent service‑level‑agreement target for the fifth consecutive year.\\n\\nRISK FACTORS\\n\\nCurrency volatility remains a key sensitivity. A seven‑percent swing in the euro‑dollar rate could compress operating margin by up to ninety basis points on an unhedged basis. Second, talent retention in advanced analytics functions has proven challenging; attrition in specialist data‑science cohorts peaked at seventeen percent during the third quarter. A two‑hundred‑basis‑point wage‑inflation scenario would reduce fiscal\\u202f2025 operating profit by roughly eleven\\u202fmillion dollars if not offset by pricing or productivity gains.\\nThird, with approximately twenty percent of revenue denominated in multi‑year fixed‑price contracts, unexpected spikes in public‑cloud infrastructure costs could pressure gross margins. Management mitigates this through committed‑use discounts and pass‑through pricing clauses but remains vigilant.\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY AND ESG PROGRESS\\n\\nScope\\u202f1 and Scope\\u202f2 emissions fell eighteen percent year over year after Innovexa executed a one‑hundred‑percent renewable‑energy contract for its Phoenix data centre and introduced real‑time power‑capping algorithms. A new internal carbon‑pricing model—sixty dollars per metric tonne—now informs capital‑budget decisions. Social‑impact initiatives delivered twenty‑four thousand volunteer hours to STEM mentorship programs in under‑served school districts. Diversity metrics improved modestly, with women representing thirty‑one percent of technical leadership roles, up from twenty‑seven percent last year.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC INITIATIVES\\n\\nHorizon\\u202f2030 drives value creation through three pillars. First, Cloud\\u202fModernisation aims to migrate seventy percent of on‑prem workloads to multi‑cloud infrastructure by fiscal\\u202f2026, unlocking elasticity and cost efficiency. Second, the AI‑Native Platform initiative embeds generative co‑pilots into every major product family, enabling natural‑language workflow configuration and automated anomaly detection. Early adopter feedback indicates a thirty‑eight‑percent reduction in manual configuration time.\\nThird, Global\\u202fDelivery\\u202f2.0 expands near‑shore development hubs in Lisbon, Bogotá, and Kraków. The centres are designed around agile pods, integrated security operations, and continuous‑improvement cadences, targeting a fifteen‑percent reduction in cost‑to‑serve while preserving high customer‑satisfaction scores.\\n\\nOUTLOOK\\n\\nFor fiscal\\u202f2025 Innovexa guides to organic revenue growth between nine and eleven percent and an operating‑margin range of 15.5 to 16\\u202fpercent. Capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: internal innovation first, then selective M\\\\&A to enhance vertical capabilities, and finally share‑buyback stabilisation when accretive. Although macro‑economic visibility is mixed, the first‑quarter qualified pipeline is twenty‑two percent ahead of prior‑year comparables, suggesting sustained top‑line momentum. Management continues to assume a mid‑single‑digit\\u202fpercent inflation scenario and has modelled contingency plans for higher rates.\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\u202fA: SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL COMMENTARY\\n\\nCore‑Solutions posted revenue of 543\\u202fmillion dollars with a segment operating margin of 24\\u202fpercent, aided by license‑to‑SaaS conversions and the continued shift toward DevSecOps retainers. Cloud\\u202fIntegration delivered 428\\u202fmillion dollars at a 21‑percent margin as clients accelerated data‑mesh deployments. Legacy\\u202fLicensing recorded 288\\u202fmillion dollars, generating a 41‑percent margin that remains accretive but is expected to decline as the installed base migrates.\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\u202fB: CUSTOMER‑SATISFACTION UPDATE\\n\\nOverall Net\\u202fPromoter\\u202fScore improved to seventy‑two from sixty‑eight the prior year.

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovexa Holdings concluded Fiscal Year 2024 in a solid strategic and financial position, despite the overhang of inflationary pressure, supply‑chain dislocation, and uneven enterprise‑IT sentiment. Full‑year revenue climbed to 1 billion 260 million US dollars, an increase of roughly twelve percent compared with the prior year, while net profit improved to 147 million dollars. Operating cash flow reached 184 million dollars, supporting a free‑cash‑flow margin above thirteen percent. Management attributes the advance to a disciplined shift toward higher‑margin recurring subscriptions, a moderation in component costs during the second half, and early benefits from the Horizon 2030 transformation program.\n",
      "The company has three reportable segments. Core Solutions, which delivers application‑modernisation and hybrid‑cloud migration services, produced 43 percent of revenue and grew seventeen percent year over year. Cloud Integration, focused on API orchestration and data‑fabric design, represented 34 percent of revenue and expanded eleven percent. The Legacy Licensing segment contracted three percent, now representing twenty‑three percent of the top line, as on‑premises perpetual sales continue to decline in line with management expectations.\n",
      "Global macro headwinds were most visible during the first quarter, when a pause in procurement cycles reduced order intake by nine percent versus the comparable 2023 period. Orders steadily recovered through the remainder of the year, finishing four percent above prior year in the fourth quarter. Pipeline velocity is tracking twenty‑two percent ahead of the prior‑year‐to‑date pace as of March 2025, reflecting renewed demand for mid‑market digitisation projects in North America and Europe.\n",

      "MARKET OVERVIEW\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry analysts continue to forecast high‑single‑digit compound annual growth for cloud‑native middleware and digital‑transformation consulting through 2028. The total addressable market for Innovexa’s portfolio is estimated at sixty‑seven billion dollars. North America and the EMEA region together generated seventy‑four percent of company revenue during 2024. Asia‑Pacific contributed eighteen percent, powered by strong demand in Australia, India, and Japan, while Latin America accounted for the remaining eight percent.\n",
      "Competition intensified as tier‑one global system integrators pressed further into the mid‑market; nevertheless, Innovexa maintained a mid‑teens market share thanks to deep domain expertise in regulated verticals such as financial services and life sciences. Gartner’s latest Magic Quadrant placed the firm in the Leaders section for Hybrid‑Cloud Orchestration, citing its robust reference architecture, a service‑level track record above 99.98 percent uptime, and its consultative account‑management model.\n",
