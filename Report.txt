EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Innovexa Holdings concluded Fiscal Year 2024 in a solid strategic and financial position, despite the overhang of inflationary pressure, supply‑chain dislocation, and uneven enterprise‑IT sentiment. Full‑year revenue climbed to 1 billion 260 million US dollars, an increase of roughly twelve percent compared with the prior year, while net profit improved to 147 million dollars. Operating cash flow reached 184 million dollars, supporting a free‑cash‑flow margin above thirteen percent. Management attributes the advance to a disciplined shift toward higher‑margin recurring subscriptions, a moderation in component costs during the second half, and early benefits from the Horizon 2030 transformation program.
The company has three reportable segments. Core Solutions, which delivers application‑modernisation and hybrid‑cloud migration services, produced 43 percent of revenue and grew seventeen percent year over year. Cloud Integration, focused on API orchestration and data‑fabric design, represented 34 percent of revenue and expanded eleven percent. The Legacy Licensing segment contracted three percent, now representing twenty‑three percent of the top line, as on‑premises perpetual sales continue to decline in line with management expectations.
Global macro headwinds were most visible during the first quarter, when a pause in procurement cycles reduced order intake by nine percent versus the comparable 2023 period. Orders steadily recovered through the remainder of the year, finishing four percent above prior year in the fourth quarter. Pipeline velocity is tracking twenty‑two percent ahead of the prior‑year‐to‑date pace as of March 2025, reflecting renewed demand for mid‑market digitisation projects in North America and Europe.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Industry analysts continue to forecast high‑single‑digit compound annual growth for cloud‑native middleware and digital‑transformation consulting through 2028. The total addressable market for Innovexa’s portfolio is estimated at sixty‑seven billion dollars. North America and the EMEA region together generated seventy‑four percent of company revenue during 2024. Asia‑Pacific contributed eighteen percent, powered by strong demand in Australia, India, and Japan, while Latin America accounted for the remaining eight percent.
Competition intensified as tier‑one global system integrators pressed further into the mid‑market; nevertheless, Innovexa maintained a mid‑teens market share thanks to deep domain expertise in regulated verticals such as financial services and life sciences. Gartner’s latest Magic Quadrant placed the firm in the Leaders section for Hybrid‑Cloud Orchestration, citing its robust reference architecture, a service‑level track record above 99.98 percent uptime, and its consultative account‑management model.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Revenue rose from 1 billion 127 million dollars to 1 billion 259 million dollars. Gross margin expanded by 130 basis points to 42.5 percent, reflecting a richer software mix and incremental services automation. Operating expenses were held to growth of eight percent. Research‑and‑development investment remained at six‑and‑a‑half percent of revenue, supporting the release of the CX‑Fusion 5.0 platform, while selling, general, and administrative expenses were flat as a percentage of sales. Diluted earnings per share increased to 1 dollar 57 cents, compared with 1 dollar 45 cents in fiscal 2023.
Strong cash generation permitted 48 million dollars of share repurchases, 31 million dollars in bolt‑on acquisitions, and the retirement of the remaining 25 million dollars on the 2025 convertible‑note tranche without jeopardising liquidity. The year‑end net‑cash position was 96 million dollars. Innovexa maintains an undrawn revolving credit facility of 300 million dollars.

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

– The company completed 128 enterprise go‑lives of CX‑Fusion 5.0, reducing average client onboarding time by twenty‑seven days and saving an estimated five million dollars in cumulative professional‑services labour.

– Three tuck‑in acquisitions—NovaSec AI, DataMesh Labs, and Blue Kite Solutions—added two hundred twenty specialised engineers and accelerated the rollout of AI‑powered quality‑assurance tooling.

– A robotics‑enabled warehouse redesign reduced fulfilment expense by four‑point‑seven million dollars annually. Hardware lead times declined from forty‑one to twenty‑nine days.

– System uptime across all SaaS instances reached 99.982 percent, surpassing the 99.95‑percent service‑level‑agreement target for the fifth consecutive year.

RISK FACTORS

Currency volatility remains a key sensitivity. A seven‑percent swing in the euro‑dollar rate could compress operating margin by up to ninety basis points on an unhedged basis. Second, talent retention in advanced analytics functions has proven challenging; attrition in specialist data‑science cohorts peaked at seventeen percent during the third quarter. A two‑hundred‑basis‑point wage‑inflation scenario would reduce fiscal 2025 operating profit by roughly eleven million dollars if not offset by pricing or productivity gains.
Third, with approximately twenty percent of revenue denominated in multi‑year fixed‑price contracts, unexpected spikes in public‑cloud infrastructure costs could pressure gross margins. Management mitigates this through committed‑use discounts and pass‑through pricing clauses but remains vigilant.

SUSTAINABILITY AND ESG PROGRESS

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions fell eighteen percent year over year after Innovexa executed a one‑hundred‑percent renewable‑energy contract for its Phoenix data centre and introduced real‑time power‑capping algorithms. A new internal carbon‑pricing model—sixty dollars per metric tonne—now informs capital‑budget decisions. Social‑impact initiatives delivered twenty‑four thousand volunteer hours to STEM mentorship programs in under‑served school districts. Diversity metrics improved modestly, with women representing thirty‑one percent of technical leadership roles, up from twenty‑seven percent last year.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Horizon 2030 drives value creation through three pillars. First, Cloud Modernisation aims to migrate seventy percent of on‑prem workloads to multi‑cloud infrastructure by fiscal 2026, unlocking elasticity and cost efficiency. Second, the AI‑Native Platform initiative embeds generative co‑pilots into every major product family, enabling natural‑language workflow configuration and automated anomaly detection. Early adopter feedback indicates a thirty‑eight‑percent reduction in manual configuration time.
Third, Global Delivery 2.0 expands near‑shore development hubs in Lisbon, Bogotá, and Kraków. The centres are designed around agile pods, integrated security operations, and continuous‑improvement cadences, targeting a fifteen‑percent reduction in cost‑to‑serve while preserving high customer‑satisfaction scores.

OUTLOOK

For fiscal 2025 Innovexa guides to organic revenue growth between nine and eleven percent and an operating‑margin range of 15.5 to 16 percent. Capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: internal innovation first, then selective M\&A to enhance vertical capabilities, and finally share‑buyback stabilisation when accretive. Although macro‑economic visibility is mixed, the first‑quarter qualified pipeline is twenty‑two percent ahead of prior‑year comparables, suggesting sustained top‑line momentum. Management continues to assume a mid‑single‑digit percent inflation scenario and has modelled contingency plans for higher rates.

APPENDIX A: SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL COMMENTARY

Core‑Solutions posted revenue of 543 million dollars with a segment operating margin of 24 percent, aided by license‑to‑SaaS conversions and the continued shift toward DevSecOps retainers. Cloud Integration delivered 428 million dollars at a 21‑percent margin as clients accelerated data‑mesh deployments. Legacy Licensing recorded 288 million dollars, generating a 41‑percent margin that remains accretive but is expected to decline as the installed base migrates.

APPENDIX B: CUSTOMER‑SATISFACTION UPDATE

Overall Net Promoter Score improved to seventy‑two from sixty‑eight the prior year. Ninety‑one percent of surveyed enterprise clients rated Innovexa’s support as “excellent” or “good”. Key drivers of satisfaction include rapid ticket resolution, depth of pre‑sales solution architects, and proactive performance tuning via the AI‑enabled telemetry engine.

APPENDIX C: GLOSSARY OF NON‑GAAP MEASURES

“EBIT” refers to earnings before interest and taxes, excluding restructuring charges. “Free cash flow” is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. “Gross margin” represents revenue minus cost of goods sold, divided by revenue.
